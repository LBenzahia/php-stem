ChangeLog:

27 Nov 2002

* Release of 1.3.
* Added some simple tests. The real tests involve
  gigantic word lists, and to save space, they're
  gzipped, so you need zlib enabled to do them.

26 Nov 2002

* Fixed up a bunch of tests. Note that English and
  Norwegian still don't work properly, as the output
  files seem to be behind on the Snowball site.

25 Nov 2002

* Various stemming algorithms changed to match changes
  found at Dr. Porter's site. TAKE NOTE: these may not be
  100% backwardly compatible with older versions of
  stem-php. You've been warned.


22 Nov 2002

* Finally did some more work. Added the ability to
  enable/disable languages via stemconf.h.
* New function: bool stem_enabled(int lang) -- returns
  true if the language has been enabled, false if it
  hasn't.
* Added a Finnish language stemmer.

06 May 2002

* Small fixes to the phpinfo() table block.

19 Apr 2002

* Although I released 1.2 yesterday, Dr. Porter was so
  quick to fix the minor bug (?) I found in Snowball
  that I'm releasing a new version with the updated
  stemmers already. This version is 1.2.1.

18 Apr 2002

* Released version 1.2.
* Added fixes to the Snowball generated sources to make
  them compile on Windows with VC++.
* Added VC++ 6 project files.

15 Apr 2002

* Removed some dumbass comments from stem.c.
* Added an include for stdlib.h to api.c to qwell some
  warnings.

13 Mar 2002

* Updated the sources for Snowball. See COPYING for the 
  specific files. This should fix a small memory leak. 

12 Feb 2002

* Finished the extension, for the most part.
* Yea.

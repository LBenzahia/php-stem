In this release, the output created by Snowball has been modified slightly
from the "official" versions to correct for some errors and warnings given
about zero-sized arrays, which are forbidden by ANSI/ISO C. The changes look
something like this:

original: static symbol s_0_0[0] = {  };
corrected: static symbol s_0_0[1] = { '\0' };

This problem occurs in the following files:

dutch.c
english.c
french.c
german.c
italian.c
porter.c
portuguese.c
spanish.c

There is also a small change in api.c to stop a warning message about
calloc() and free() being undefined. All that was done here is an
extra line to #include <stdlib.h>.

The wrapper code for this extension was written by J Smith.

The actual stemmers were all the result of C code spit out
by Dr. M.F. Porter's Snowball string processor. Snowball
essentially takes a file containing a stemmer definition
written in the Snowball language and outputs the equivalent
in ANSI C. Very cool.

Very small changes were made to the sources generated by
Snowball. See COPYING for details.
